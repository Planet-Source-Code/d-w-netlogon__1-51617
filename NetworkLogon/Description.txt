This example shows how to send a username and password to a network 
login box and will not work for the power on logon. Some networks 
disable the save username and password function making you type it in 
every time after a timeout period. I'm too lazy for that. Could be adapted 
to many other uses. I fixed a bug where a static variable needed to be
cleared or sub would fail after first try.
